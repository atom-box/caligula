    The Kata Question was originally stated:
    - three for a dollar (so whatâ€™s the price if I buy 4, or 5?)
    - $1.99/pound (so what does 4 ounces cost?)
    - buy two, get one free (so does the third item have a price?)

    My thoughts:
    - BOGO enabled or not is a bool.
    - BOGOdenabled needs a checker ("Worth of item cannot become less than zero unless SellAtLoss is True. ")
    - Sell at loss bool is checked during cost set BOBO set price set, bogoenabled set.
